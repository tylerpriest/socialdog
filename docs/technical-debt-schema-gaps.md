# Technical Debt: Schema Gaps

## Problem Statement

Our current schema implementation has significant gaps compared to production requirements. This document tracks what's missing, why it's needed, and the impact of delaying implementation.

## Priority Level: **HIGH**

These gaps are blocking core functionality and preventing MVP launch readiness.

## Dependencies

- Schema enhancement specification âœ… Complete
- MVP definition âœ… Complete
- Production field analysis âœ… Complete

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All CRITICAL schema gaps documented with impact assessment
- [ ] Implementation priority order established
- [ ] Technical debt properly categorized and tracked
- [ ] Clear migration path identified for each gap

## Current Schema Debt Inventory

### **CRITICAL Debt** ðŸ”¥ (Blocks MVP Launch)

#### 1. **Advanced Dog Matching Fields - MISSING**
**Current State**: Basic dog profiles with name, breed, age, size only
**Production Requirement**: Comprehensive behavioral compatibility matching
**Missing Fields**:
```typescript
// MISSING from Dog interface
energyLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
trainingLevel: 'basic' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced' | 'professional'
socialization: 'excellent' | 'good' | 'needs_work'
goodWithKids: boolean
goodWithDogs: boolean
goodWithCats: boolean
interactionStyles: string[]
```
**Impact**:
- Users cannot find compatible dogs
- Poor matching leads to failed interactions
- Core platform value proposition compromised
- User retention likely to be low

**Technical Debt Cost**: HIGH - Matching algorithm is too simplistic for production

#### 2. **Health Records System - COMPLETELY MISSING**
**Current State**: No health tracking capability
**Production Requirement**: Full vaccination and treatment tracking
**Missing Tables**:
```typescript
// MISSING interfaces
Vaccination {
  dogId: string
  name: string
  date: string
  frequency: string
  nextDueDate: string
}
WormingTreatment { /* similar structure */ }
FleaTreatment { /* similar structure */ }
```
**Impact**:
- Dog owners cannot track essential health information
- No competitive advantage over basic solutions
- Missing key user retention feature
- Legal liability if health issues arise

**Technical Debt Cost**: HIGH - Core feature expected by users

#### 3. **Location Precision - âœ… RESOLVED**
**Previous State**: String-based location (e.g., "Auckland")
**Solution Implemented**: Nominatim API integration with OpenStreetMap
**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// âœ… RESOLVED with enhanced location system
location: {
  lat: number               // Precise coordinates from Nominatim
  lng: number               // Precise coordinates from Nominatim
}
locationDisplay: string     // User-friendly address display
```
**Benefits Achieved**:
- âœ… Comprehensive NZ address coverage (every street address)
- âœ… Free API with no ongoing costs
- âœ… Accurate distance-based matching capability
- âœ… "Dogs within X km" functionality ready for implementation
- âœ… Competitive advantage with precise location matching

**Technical Debt**: RESOLVED - Zero cost, maximum coverage solution

### **HIGH Debt** âš¡ (Affects Production Readiness)

#### 4. **Authentication Completeness - MISSING FEATURES**
**Current State**: Basic email/password only
**Production Requirement**: Complete auth system with recovery
**Missing Features**:
- Password reset flow
- Email verification
- Google OAuth (optional)
- Account security features

**Impact**:
- Users locked out if they forget passwords
- Unverified email addresses (delivery issues)
- Lower conversion rates without social login
- Support burden from auth issues

**Technical Debt Cost**: MEDIUM - Affects user onboarding

#### 5. **Real Database Integration - MOCKED**
**Current State**: All data operations are mocked with console.log
**Production Requirement**: Full Supabase integration
**Missing Implementation**:
- Real database CRUD operations
- Data persistence
- User session management
- Production error handling

**Impact**:
- No data persistence (users lose everything on refresh)
- Cannot test real user workflows
- No actual platform functionality
- Demo-only application

**Technical Debt Cost**: CRITICAL - Blocks any real usage

### **MEDIUM Debt** ðŸ“ˆ (Impacts User Engagement)

#### 6. **Social Features - MISSING**
**Current State**: No social interaction beyond basic messaging UI
**Production Requirement**: Complete social platform features
**Missing Features**:
- Friend system
- Notifications
- User blocking
- Reporting system

**Impact**:
- Users cannot build connections
- No engagement beyond initial matching
- No safety features for problematic users
- Lower platform stickiness

**Technical Debt Cost**: MEDIUM - Affects engagement, not core functionality

#### 7. **Message System - MOCKED UI**
**Current State**: Message UI exists but no real functionality
**Production Requirement**: Real-time messaging with Supabase
**Missing Implementation**:
- Real message sending/receiving
- Conversation threading
- Message persistence
- Real-time updates

**Impact**:
- Users cannot actually communicate
- Core user journey broken
- Platform unusable for its primary purpose

**Technical Debt Cost**: HIGH - Core functionality missing

### **LOW Debt** âœ¨ (Future Optimizations)

#### 8. **Advanced User Profiles - BASIC**
**Current State**: Minimal user profile fields
**Production Enhancement**: Rich user profiles
**Missing Fields**:
- Age
- Detailed bio
- Multiple profile photos
- Preferences and settings

**Impact**:
- Limited user self-expression
- Reduced matching context
- Lower engagement

**Technical Debt Cost**: LOW - Nice to have, not essential

## Debt Impact Analysis

### **User Experience Impact**
- **CRITICAL**: Core matching functionality compromised
- **HIGH**: Users cannot complete basic workflows
- **MEDIUM**: Reduced engagement and retention
- **LOW**: Limited customization options

### **Business Impact**
- **Revenue**: Cannot charge for premium features without basic functionality
- **Competition**: Significantly behind feature-complete competitors
- **Growth**: Poor user experience limits viral growth
- **Support**: High support burden from missing features

### **Technical Impact**
- **Maintenance**: Mocked implementations create confusion
- **Testing**: Cannot test real user workflows
- **Scalability**: No real load or performance testing possible
- **Security**: Missing auth features create vulnerability

## Debt Repayment Strategy

### **Phase 1: Critical Debt (Week 1-2)**
**Priority**: Fix launch-blocking issues
1. Update TypeScript types with comprehensive fields
2. Implement real database integration
3. Add advanced dog matching fields
4. Complete authentication features

### **Phase 2: High Impact Debt (Week 3-4)**
**Priority**: Production readiness
1. Build real messaging system
2. Add health records tracking
3. Implement location precision
4. Complete user workflows

### **Phase 3: Engagement Debt (Week 5-6)**
**Priority**: User retention
1. Add social features (friends, notifications)
2. Enhance user profiles
3. Build safety features (blocking, reporting)

## Migration Considerations

### **Data Migration**
- Current: No real data to migrate (everything mocked)
- Future: Will need migration strategy when moving to production database
- Risk: Low (no existing production data)

### **Code Migration**
- Current: Replace mocked implementations with real ones
- Complexity: Medium (well-structured component architecture)
- Testing: All changes require new tests

### **User Migration**
- Current: No existing users to migrate
- Future: Plan needed for schema changes after launch
- Risk: Low initially, increases with user base

## Monitoring and Tracking

### **Debt Metrics**
- **Coverage**: % of production-required fields implemented
- **Functionality**: % of core user workflows fully functional
- **Performance**: Load testing results vs requirements
- **User Impact**: Support tickets related to missing features

### **Current Debt Status**
- **Schema Completeness**: ~30% (basic fields only)
- **Functionality**: ~20% (UI exists, no backend)
- **Production Readiness**: ~15% (major features missing)

### **Target Debt Levels**
- **Phase 1 Target**: 80% schema completeness, 60% functionality
- **Phase 2 Target**: 95% schema completeness, 85% functionality
- **Launch Target**: 100% core schema, 95% core functionality

## Technical Debt Prevention

### **Future Safeguards**
1. **Specification-First Development** - No code without specs
2. **Feature Parity Checks** - Compare against production requirements
3. **Regular Debt Reviews** - Monthly assessment of growing technical debt
4. **User Story Validation** - Test all features with real user workflows

### **Documentation Requirements**
- Update this document monthly
- Track debt repayment progress
- Document new debt as it's identified
- Maintain migration plans for major changes
